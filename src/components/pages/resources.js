          What is a blog?
        </h1>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", marginTop: "2vh" }}>
          A blog is derived from a “weblog,” a term used to describe websites
          that display information on a particular topic or several topics. A
          blog has a diary-like interface where the latest content is displayed
          at the top and the older posts in subsequent positions.

        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", marginTop: "2vh" }}>
          Blogging makes it easier to assert the online presence of your
          personal or professional brand. You can make yourself popular as an
          expert in an online field or a particular topic by regularly
          publishing content.
